# ms3-contract-proc-api
A Mulesoft project I created while working with MS3. It calls several other process and system APIs that I and my colleagues collectively made (also in Mulesoft) to create or read all of the necessary aspects of a contract that MS3 would use. It is currently being used on their internal portal.
